## chan

**C** **Ha**cker **N**ews client

To compile and run:

    make
    bin/chan

Depends on ncurses and libcurl.

The default key bindings are `j`/`k` to move around, `o` to open the URL in
your default browser (requires xdg-utils), Enter to view the comments of a
submission, and `q` to go back or quit. (More to be added, of course.)
